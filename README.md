# Bookish Bliss

A e-library website where people can borrow book.

I have developed an e-library website where users can borrow and return books. Since there is no dashboard, users have the ability to perform CRUD operations, but they must log in first. To ensure the security of the website, I have implemented JWT for authentication.
